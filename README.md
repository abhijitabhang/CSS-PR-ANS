 List of Programs
 
 
1. Write a JavaScript program to concatenate two strings and return the result. If the length of the strings are not same then remove the characters from the longer string.
2. Write a JavaScript program to create a new string from a given string, removing the first and last characters of the string if the first or last characters are 'P'. Return the original string if the condition is not satisfied.
3. Write a JavaScript program to test whether an array of integers of length 2 contains 1 or a 3.
4. Write a JavaScript code to divide a given array of positive integers into two parts. First element goes to first part, second element goes to second part, and third element goes to first part and so on. Now compute the sum of two parts and store into an array of size two.
5. Write a JavaScript program to find the types of a given angle. 
	Types of angles:
		a. Acute angle: An angle between 0 and 90 degrees.
		b. Right angle: An 90 degree angle.
		c. Obtuse angle: An angle between 90 and 180 degrees.
		d. Straight angle: A 180 degree angle.
6. Write a JavaScript program to find the kth greatest element of a given array of integers
7. Write a JavaScript program to switch case of the minimum possible number of letters to make a given string written in the upper case or in the lower case.
	Fox example 
		"Write" will be “write”
		&
		"PHp" will be "PHP" 
8. Write a JavaScript program to sort the strings of a given array of strings in the order of increasing lengths.
9. Write a JavaScript program to compute the sum of all digits that occur in a given string.
10. Write a JavaScript program to compute the sum of cubes of all integer from 1 to a given integer.
11. Write a JavaScript program to get the current date.
	Expected Output :
		mm-dd-yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy or dd-mm-yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy
12. Write a JavaScript program to convert temperatures to and from Celsius, Fahrenheit.
	[ Formula : c/5 = (f-32)/9 [ where c = temperature in Celsius and f = temperature in Fahrenheit ]
		Expected Output :
			60°C is 140 °F
			45°F is 7.222222222222222°C
13. Write a JavaScript program to compute the absolute difference between a specified number and 19. Returns triple their absolute difference if the specified number is greater than 19.
14. Write a JavaScript program to concatenate two strings and return the result. If the length of the strings is not same then remove the characters from the longer string.
